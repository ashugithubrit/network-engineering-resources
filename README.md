## Cybersecurity Transition Path

### Recommended Skill Path
1. Master core networking (routing, switching, VLANs, firewalls)  
2. Build lab experience with packet capture & traffic analysis  
3. Learn Linux fundamentals & scripting  
4. Understand identity, access, and authentication  
5. Develop SIEM/SOC investigation workflows  
6. Study attack techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)  
7. Learn threat intelligence fundamentals  
8. Build portfolio projects (OSINT, threat hunting, labs)  

### Key Domains to Focus On
- Packet analysis  
- EDR / SOC workflows  
- Network monitoring (Zeek, NetFlow)  
- Threat intelligence basics  
- Cloud networking security  
- Identity & access control
